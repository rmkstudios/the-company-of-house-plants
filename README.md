# The Company of House Plants

View the live site here: [The Company of House Plants](https://houseplants.backedbyryan.com/)

This project was coded from the ground up in React to provide a clean and easy to use database of house plant information and care instructions.

No API existed for this information, so I compiled the information myself into a JSON file that is used as the database for this site. The source of the fantastic data was [House Plants Expert](https://www.houseplantsexpert.com/).

## React Libraries Used

Most of the elements were created manually in CSS.
In addition, I used Chakra UI for a few elements such as the mobile drop-down menu.

Icons are supplied from Chakra UI and React Icons.

Navigation is taken care of using React Router Dom.

Homepage fade animations are taken care of using React Animation On Scroll.
